# sudoku-solver-javascript
I don't know what theoretical algorithm. I applied my methods of solving into codes. :D

This was written before I studied any sudoku solving algorithms. It's my human way of solving sudoku. I maybe a beginner in sudoku.
I only play exact moves; exact numbers. I check horizonally, vertically and in a local 3x3 box.
The JS code is converting my thinking into algorithm.
